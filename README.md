## Description
The project is a Node.js-based command-line application designed to streamline the creation of well-structured README files for software projects. It utilizes the 'inquirer' package to prompt users with a series of questions, allowing them to input key project details, including the project's title, license, description, installation instructions, usage examples, and more. Users can also choose to add live deployment links, badges, and even collaborate by specifying GitHub usernames. The application generates a professionally formatted README file, which serves as an essential documentation and introduction for the project, helping developers and users understand its purpose, features, and how to use it effectively.
